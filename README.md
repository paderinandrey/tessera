# Tessera

**Tessera** is a self-hosted privacy gateway for LLM traffic. It sits as a transparent
reverse proxy between your application and an LLM provider (OpenAI- or
Anthropic-compatible APIs): personal data is replaced with placeholders on the way to
the model and restored in the response. Your application changes one thing — the base URL.

> In ancient Rome, a *tessera* was a token that stood in for an identity.
> Tessera replaces identities with controlled tokens — and puts them back.

## Why

Companies in regulated environments (banks, law firms, fiduciaries, insurers, medical
networks) want to use LLMs but cannot send client data to a third party. Tessera is a
**technical measure of pseudonymization** (GDPR Art. 32(1)(a)): the mapping table never
leaves your perimeter, the provider only ever sees placeholders.

**What Tessera does not claim:** it does not take you out of GDPR scope, and it is not
anonymization. Pseudonymized data remains personal data for you as the controller.
Tessera reduces exposure and gives your DPO a measurable, evidence-backed argument —
nothing more, nothing less.

## Design principles

- **Detection quality first.** The moat is high-quality PII detection in **French and
  German** (with code-switching), Swiss and EU identifiers with checksum validation,
  GDPR Art. 9 special categories, and quasi-identifiers — measured on a reproducible
  benchmark.
- **Fail-closed by default.** An unparsed request body or a lost mapping aborts the
  request; it never silently forwards raw data.
- **Nothing leaves the perimeter.** Self-hosted, no telemetry, no license phone-home.
  Audit logs never contain original values.
- **Minimal infrastructure.** Two containers (Rust gateway + Python detector), config in
  TOML/YAML, in-memory session mapping, append-only JSONL audit. No database, no Redis.

## Architecture

```
tessera/
  detector/    Python detection service: deterministic recognizers with checksum
               validation, NER (GLiNER/ONNX), context boosting. Stable HTTP contract.
  gateway/     Rust reverse proxy (planned): HTTP/SSE, placeholder substitution and
               restoration, session mapping, audit. Wave 1.
  evaluation/  Public synthetic corpus and metrics harness (planned). The manually
               annotated corpus stays private and never enters this repository.
```

## Status

Early development — Wave 0 (detector core). Not ready for production use.
